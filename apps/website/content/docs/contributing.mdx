Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Chainless**.  
Every bug fix, improvement, documentation update, and new idea helps the project grow.

Chainless is a Python-only framework, so contributions revolve around Python code quality, tooling, FlowServer improvements, examples, and documentation.

---

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository and create a descriptive branch  
   Example: `feat/tool-tracking`, `fix/async-agent-bug`, `docs/flowserver`.
2. Implement your changes in a focused, well-scoped way.  
   Avoid mixing unrelated edits in the same PR.
3. Add or update **tests** when necessary.
4. Run tests locally before opening a PR.
5. Open a **pull request** against `main` with:
   - What you changed  
   - Why it matters  
   - Example usage if applicable

This keeps the review process fast and clean.

## Project Structure (High-Level Overview)

Although Chainless evolves quickly, the core layout is usually:

- `chainless/agent` — Agent system  
- `chainless/tool` — Tool wrapper  
- `chainless/taskflow` — TaskFlow engine  
- `chainless/exp/server` — FlowServer  
- `chainless/schemas` — Pydantic models  
- `tests/` — test suite  
- `apps/website/content/docs` — documentation pages  
- `examples/` — real-world usage examples

If you're unsure where your contribution fits, feel free to open an issue first.

## Coding Guidelines

- **Python 3.9+** is required  
- Follow PEP8 standards  
- Prefer clear, readable code over clever tricks  
- Keep functions small and maintainable  
- Document public APIs and add docstrings  
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions — Chainless is meant to stay lightweight

---

## Documentation Contributions

Docs live in the `apps/website/content/docs/` directory as MDX files.

Improvements you can make:

- Fix unclear explanations  
- Add missing examples  
- Expand FlowServer or TaskFlow tutorials  
- Clarify errors, edge cases, or tool behavior  
- Improve English phrasing or formatting

Documentation PRs are always welcome and often the easiest way to start contributing.

---

## Tests

When fixing bugs or adding features:

- Add a minimal test case that reproduces the issue  
- Place tests under `tests/`  
- Keep tests simple and descriptive  
- Use realistic input/output whenever possible

Tests help prevent regressions and ensure Chainless remains stable.

## Issues & Feature Requests

You can open issues for:

- Bugs  
- Missing features  
- Proposals for improvements  
- Questions about design decisions  

Provide details like:

- A reproducible code snippet  
- Expected vs actual behavior  
- Python version  
- Chainless version

Clear reports lead to faster fixes.
