# What is Chainless?

**Chainless is a lightweight, modular framework to build task-oriented AI agents and orchestrate them in intelligent flows.**

It allows you to define agents, tools, and tasks in a composable and scalable way — ideal for both personal projects and production-grade pipelines.

```bash
pip install chainless
```

```python
from chainless import Tool, Agent, TaskFlow

def greet(name: str):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

tool = Tool("Greeter", "Greets the user", greet)

agent = Agent("WelcomeAgent", tools=[tool])
flow = TaskFlow("GreetFlow").add_agent("WelcomeAgent", agent)

flow.step("WelcomeAgent", input_map={"input": "{{input}}"})

print(flow.run("Alice")["output"])
```

| Component  | Description                                                  | Key Features                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent      | A self-contained unit powered by an LLM and optional tools   | - Tool invocation  - Custom start hooks  - System prompts  - Stateless or memory-driven design |
| Tool       | A callable Python function with metadata                     | - Reusable  - Easily registered  - Simple input/output schema                                  |
| TaskFlow   | Composable flow engine that connects agents together         | - Sequential/Parallel execution  - Input mapping  - Output routing                             |
| Custom Start | Override how an agent processes data                      | - Direct LLM calls  - Prompt chaining  - Arbitrary preprocessing logic                         |

## Core Features

<CardGroup cols="2">
  <Card title="Modular Agents" icon="robot">
    Design lightweight agents that use tools or reason directly. Compose complex logic without over-engineering.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Composable TaskFlows" icon="flow-chart">
    Connect agents in flexible sequences or parallel blocks. Build entire pipelines by just describing the data flow.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Native Python Tools" icon="toolbox">
    Define your own tools with pure Python. Chainless automatically wraps them with metadata for agent usage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom Execution Hooks" icon="sliders">
    Fully control how an agent executes. Inject prompts, chain models, or pre/post-process using decorators.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Zero-Bloat, Server-Free" icon="feather">
    Keep it local. Chainless doesn’t force you into a runtime. No cloud service, no lock-in — just Python.
  </Card>
  <Card title="LLM Agnostic" icon="plug">
    Bring your own model — from OpenAI, Groq, DeepSeek, Ollama or others. Chainless is fully compatible.
